Time until the lump is discovered, time until diagnosis, time until a therapy is chosen, time bought by treatments that stretch survival by months when decades are needed. For patients and families, each interval is both hope and dread. For clinicians, it is the weight of complexity and uncertainty pressed into every decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe we can change the slope of that story. Artificial intelligence is often described as a tool, but in oncology it could become something deeper: a kind of superintelligence woven through the discipline, catalyzing progress at the pace of ideas rather than the pace of paperwork and bottlenecked trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
