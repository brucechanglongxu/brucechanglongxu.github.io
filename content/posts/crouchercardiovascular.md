This summer I had the opportunity to present at the Croucher Foundation Summer Course in Cardiovascular Science, where I shared work developed with my mentors at the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute on immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated myocarditis. This is a rare but highly fatal complication of PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade, with incidence as low as 0.04–1.4% but mortality approaching 40%. Using single-cell RNA-seq, TCR-seq, and CITE-seq, our group identified a clear axis of disease biology: CXCR3^hi CD8+ T cells clonally expand in the myocardium with upregulated perforin and granzyme programs, while simultaneously a novel macrophage population expressing CXCL9 and CXCL10 emerges. These interferon-inducible chemokines create steep local gradients that recruit and retain the cytotoxic T cells, producing chemokine “niches” in the heart that amplify injury rather than resolving it.

This model aligns with structural data now available for CXCR3. Recent cryo-EM maps of CXCR3 bound to small-molecule antagonists such as AMG487 reveal the orthosteric binding pocket, key hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions (e.g. Trp109, Tyr308, Ser304), and the conformational shifts in TM6 that determine Gαi coupling. The overlap between AMG487’s pocket and the CXCL10 N-terminal binding site shows how antagonists stabilize the receptor in an inactive conformation by occupying residues critical for ligand engagement. Taken together with single-cell dynamics, these structures provide a mechanistic explanation for how to interrupt the CXCR3–CXCL9/10 loop with drugs designed to bias receptor signaling.

The translational challenge is that CXCR3 signaling is not universally pathogenic: in viral myocarditis or acute myocardial infarction, CXCL10 may aid clearance or healing. Broad CXCR3 blockade risks impairing antiviral defense or antitumor activity. A more nuanced strategy is to engineer selective interventions. One approach is mRNA-encoded decoy receptors, such as soluble CXCR3-Fc, packaged in cardio-tropic lipid nanoparticles, which could soak up CXCL9/10 locally while sparing systemic immunity. Another is to computationally design antibodies or chemokine traps using deep generative models. In oncology, resistance mutations in BCR-ABL such as T315I forced us to invent second- and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and modern architectures—VAEs, GANs, diffusion models—can now propose such molecules directly from latent chemical space. Applying these methods to the chemokine system could produce next-generation modulators with improved selectivity and safety.

What excites me is the possibility of building multimodal foundation models that integrate single-cell immune landscapes, structural biology, and patient outcomes into unified predictive frameworks. A JEPA-like architecture trained on intent signals—whether neural in BCI or immunological in TCR clonality—could learn to align abstract goals with observed actions, predicting not just correlations but causal dynamics. For immune-mediated cardiovascular disease, this means moving from static observations of CXCR3^hi CD8+ T cells and CXCL9/10+ macrophages to actionable predictions of when and how pathogenic niches will form, and what interventions will collapse them.

Presenting this work at Croucher was a reminder that cardiovascular immunology is entering a new phase, where mechanism and modulation are tightly linked. By tracing the CXCR3 axis from clonal TCR expansion to cryo-EM structures to AI-guided therapeutic design, we can begin to see how biology, computation, and medicine can converge on a common target.
