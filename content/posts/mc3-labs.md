Over the past year, I’ve had the privilege of working with colleagues at Mayo Clinic to help establish MC3-Labs (Mayo Clinic Computational & Clinical Collaboration Labs) — a new initiative designed to bridge computational platforms and clinical practice. The mission is simple but ambitious: to weave data, models, and clinical expertise into systems that can truly translate from platform to bedside.

In shaping MC3-Labs, I’ve been fortunate to work across several projects that illustrate this vision:

1. **Platform to Bedside (npj Digital Medicine Review):** Together with Mayo colleagues, I co-authored a review submitted to npj Digital Medicine that mapped the translational pipeline for AI in healthcare — from data curation and foundation models to regulatory and clinical integration. This framework helped us think beyond model performance, focusing instead on how to build reproducible, interoperable, and bedside-ready AI platforms.
2. **Spatial Reasoning AI (SRAI) in Medicine:** We undertook one of the first scoping reviews of Spatial Reasoning AI, exploring how AI systems can reason over anatomy, motion, and workflow — not just static images. For fields like cardiology and surgery, this is essential: an echocardiogram is dynamic, a surgical field is evolving, and ICU signals unfold beat by beat. Embedding reasoning into these contexts is key to moving from lab prototypes to clinical tools.
3. **Foundation Models for Cardiology & Myocarditis:** At MC3-Labs, we began laying the groundwork for a multimodal cardiovascular foundation model, integrating echocardiography, ECG, cardiac MRI, and clinical notes. As a pilot disease, we focused on myocarditis, which is heterogeneous and often misdiagnosed. By curating viral, ICI-related, ischemic, and fulminant subtypes, we aimed to explore whether foundation models could capture subtle signatures that traditional diagnostics miss.
4. **Partnerships and MOSAIC (Yosemite / Reed Jobs Oncology Fund):** We've engaged with Yosemite (Reed Jobs’ oncology fund), contributing to early discussions around MOSAIC, a multimodal immuno-oncology response predictor. These conversations underscored how academic infrastructure like MC3-Labs can connect with external partners — bringing rigorous, provenance-aware data pipelines into dialogue with funders and translational networks eager to accelerate clinical impact, to attract up to 400k USD funding to our lab.

Looking back, what excites me most is not any single paper or pilot, but the ecosystem we’re starting to build. MC3-Labs is becoming a platform: data pipelines, foundation model workflows, and translational collaborations that can scale across oncology, cardiology, and beyond. The journey from platform to bedside is never quick — but by uniting clinical excellence at Mayo with external partnerships like Yosemite, I believe we are beginning to sketch a roadmap for how trustworthy, scalable AI in medicine can truly take shape.
