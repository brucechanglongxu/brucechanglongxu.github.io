Artificial intelligence is advancing faster than the frameworks that might guide its use. Conversations about risk and opportunity are dominated by Washington, Brussels, and Beijing. But if AI is to truly benefit humanity, the conversation cannot remain fragmented â€” it must be global, inclusive, and grounded in trust. This year, I began organizing the inaugural Hong Kong Global AI Governance Summit alongside one of my closest friends and colleagues. The vision is simple but ambitious: to bring together researchers, policymakers, clinicians, entrepreneurs, and civic leaders from across the U.S., China, and beyond to discuss how we can shape frontier AI toward human flourishing.

Hong Kong is uniquely positioned as a bridge between the East and West. It combines international finance, the legacy of the rule of law, and a vibrant civic culture. For AI governance, it offers a neutral ground - a place where voices from multiple systems and perspectives can gather without being overshadowed by a single bloc's agenda. The process of convening is already underway. I have reached out to leaders across domains:

- **Academia and medicine,** including the founding Dean of Tsinghua University's School of Medicine and global academic leaders across a variety of disciplines.
- **Industry,** with invitations to founders and executives from frontier AI labs and policy think-tanks in the United States, Asia, and Europe. 
- **Nonprofits, civic and policy organizations,** to ensure that equity and global representation remain at the center of discussion.

Bridging these voices into one room itself, is a form of progress. Indeed organizing a summit of this scale is exhilirating and daunting. Oftentimes, throughout this process I have felt the tension between ambition and humility: ambition in imagining that such an important gather could happen in Hong Kong, humility in realizing how much trust-building it requires across cultural and political divides. Each invitation that is sent is more than logistics - it is a small act of bridge-building. And already, the willingness of leaders to engage across boundaries has been a source of inspiration. 

The Hong Kong Global AI Governance Summit has not yet taken place; But even in the act of organizing, I see what is possible: that we can convene across borders, that we can talk not only about risks but about flourishing under the premise of AI, and that Hong Kong can be a stage for dialogue the world desperately needs. This is the beginning of a story - one that I hope to help write, where AI governance is not only about constraint but about enabling a world where intelligence, human and artificial, is placed in service of human flourishing.
