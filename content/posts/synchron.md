When I first encountered Synchron’s work in endovascular brain–computer interfaces, I saw more than a medical device. I saw a chance to ground the next generation of AI in something that has been missing from our models: human intent. That conviction led me not only to participate in Synchron’s Series D, but to actively advise on how to scale the AI infrastructure behind their system.

My contribution has been to help shape a thesis: that the path toward Cognitive General Intelligence (CGI) will not come only from scaling transformers, but from integrating the brain’s own signals of volition into our architectures. At Synchron, that means designing pipelines where neural activity recorded through minimally invasive stentrodes is not treated as noisy data to be decoded, but as a rich supervisory signal that can inform how models learn to represent goals, predict actions, and evaluate outcomes.

In practice, my role has been twofold. First, working with the team to think about infrastructure at scale — ensuring the neural data can be stored, versioned, and accessed with the same rigor as the world’s largest AI training corpora. Provenance and reproducibility matter as much in BCI as in oncology, and I have pushed for systems that treat every new session of neural intent not as a one-off experiment but as part of a continuously growing foundation dataset.

Second, I have helped explore how this data can shape model architectures. I brought to Synchron my interest in Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) — frameworks that don’t just autoregress over tokens, but learn to capture invariants and predict how actions transform states. Neural intent signals are, in a sense, “the missing modality” for these models: they show what the brain is trying to do before the action is executed. By linking intent → action → outcome loops, we can train systems that learn not just correlations but cognitive structure — memory, planning, abstraction. These are small steps, but they point toward an AI that reasons and acts more like we do — because it is learning from the same fabric of volition. 

For patients, the near-term value is obvious: faster, more reliable assistive systems that restore communication and agency. But the broader impact is what motivates me: using BCI to make AI cognitively grounded and human-aligned. If large language models have given us fluency, then Synchron’s neural data can give us intentionality — the crucial element that bridges prediction and cognition.

Supporting Synchron has therefore been more than an investment for me. It has been a way to test, in practice, a thesis I care deeply about: that AI should not be an alien intelligence trained on internet exhaust, but a cognitive intelligence trained in dialogue with human intention itself. My role — helping build the infrastructure, shaping the modeling approach, pushing for provenance and JEPA-like cognition — is a small but deliberate attempt to bend the trajectory of AI toward that future.

This is the work that excites me most: where neurotechnology, cognitive architectures, and patient care converge. It is where my engineering background, my research in trustworthy AI, and my conviction about human flourishing come together. And it is the space where I want to keep contributing — building not just more powerful AI, but more cognitively grounded, human-aligned intelligence for the decades to come.
