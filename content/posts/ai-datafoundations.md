Real-world ASI starts with deliberately engineered data. Write a capability spec first: target tasks, tools the model must call, modalities, latency and safety constraints. From that, draft a mixture plan—what sources you’ll use, in what proportions, on what refresh cadence—and list the gaps you must fill: rare failure modes, non-English domains, long-tail workflows, tool-use traces, time drift. The corpus should teach the behaviors you need, mirror the environment you’ll deploy into (edge cases included), and be clean to ship from a licensing and privacy standpoint.

Stand up a continuous pipeline rather than a one-off ETL. Ingest → normalize → fingerprint (near-dup & family detection) → quality scoring (heuristics + small judges) → PII/PHI handling → semantic clustering → mixture balancing → sharding/streaming. Report effective tokens, not just raw count: $$Neff=N (1−d) (1−n) (1−c)N_{\text{eff}} = N\,(1-d)\,(1-n)\,(1-c)N_{\text{eff}}​=N(1−d)(1−n)(1−c)$$, where d is the near-duplicate fraction, n the estimated noise/unlearnable share, and ccc contamination with evals or restricted licenses. Close the loop with active learning (uncertainty/diversity sampling from training traces), targeted synthetic/simulated data to plug coverage holes, and mixture controllers that re-balance when you see loss spikes or mode collapse. Stream from object stores with deterministic sharding and reproducible snapshots so runs are replayable and auditable.

Ship governance and telemetry with the data. Define a multimodal schema (text/code/image/audio/sensor/EHR) that carries lineage, consent/license tags, and retention windows. Publish a Data Card for each release (sources, proportions, filters, known risks), maintain a living risk register (privacy, bias, safety), and wire online signals—safety incidents, hallucination clusters, user-reported gaps—into the backlog for the next cut. Treat deletion as a first-class feature: fast traceability from sample → shards → checkpoints for “right to be forgotten.” Keep red-team corpora and adversarial prompts as training assets, not side files. Finally, set SLOs for the pipeline itself—freshness, audit latency, $$N_{\text{eff}}N_{\text{eff}}N_{eff}$$​/week, and cost per curated token—so Data Foundations runs with clear budgets and accountability.

## Data Infrastructure for Sim2Real and Real2Sim

**Sim2Real** is the process of taking models trained in simulation and making them robust enough to operate in the real world. It matters because training robots directly in reality is expensive, slow, and often unsafe. Simulation provides infinite data at low cost, but only if the gap between sim and real can be crossed. **Real2Sim** is the inverse process: feeding real-world logs back into the simulator so that the simulated environment stays faithful to the world it is supposed to represent. Without this calibration, simulators drift into fantasy, and the policies trained there collapse in deployment. Together, Sim2Real and Real2Sim form a loop: reality informs simulation, simulation trains policies, policies are deployed back into reality, and the cycle repeats. The strength of that loop is determined less by clever algorithms and more by the quality of the data infrastructure that connects the two sides. 

> **Sim2Real** refers to the transfer of models, policies, or representations trained in simulation to physical environments, with the objective of achieving robust performance despite discrepancies between simulated and real-world dynamics, sensing, and noise.

> **Real2Sim** denotes the process of leveraging real-world data to calibrate, update, or reconstruct smiulations such that the simulated environment accurately reflects physical reality, thereby improving the fidelity and utility of simulation for downstream training and evaluation. 

One of the biggest breakthroughs in closing the Sim2Real–Real2Sim loop has been the rise of massively parallel simulation engines like Isaac Gym, Mujoco, and Genesis. These systems run thousands of simulated environments in parallel on a single GPU cluster, making it possible to train embodied agents orders of magnitude faster than before. The innovation is not just raw throughput but the ability to integrate real-world parameter distributions directly into the simulation. Instead of hard-coded physics constants, friction coefficients or sensor noise models can be sampled from empirical data gathered in the field. The result is a simulator that reflects the statistical character of the real world, rather than a sanitized approximation.

On the real-world side, progress depends on how effectively you can log and prioritize data. Fleet-scale logging frameworks are beginning to treat data capture as an optimization problem: which episodes should we store in high fidelity, which can be compressed, and which deserve human review? Active learning signals - uncertainty in the policy's predictions, disagreement between ensemble models, sudden spikes in error - can drive the decision of what to log in detail. This shifts the burden away from brute-force data hoarding toward targeted capture of surprising or high-value events, ensuring that every gigabyte ingested moves the learning curve.
