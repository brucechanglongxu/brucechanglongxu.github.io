Real-world ASI starts with deliberately engineered data. Write a capability spec first: target tasks, tools the model must call, modalities, latency and safety constraints. From that, draft a mixture plan—what sources you’ll use, in what proportions, on what refresh cadence—and list the gaps you must fill: rare failure modes, non-English domains, long-tail workflows, tool-use traces, time drift. The corpus should teach the behaviors you need, mirror the environment you’ll deploy into (edge cases included), and be clean to ship from a licensing and privacy standpoint.

Stand up a continuous pipeline rather than a one-off ETL. Ingest → normalize → fingerprint (near-dup & family detection) → quality scoring (heuristics + small judges) → PII/PHI handling → semantic clustering → mixture balancing → sharding/streaming. Report effective tokens, not just raw count: $$N_{\text{eff}}=N (1−d) (1−n) (1−c)$$, where d is the near-duplicate fraction, n the estimated noise/unlearnable share, and ccc contamination with evals or restricted licenses. Close the loop with active learning (uncertainty/diversity sampling from training traces), targeted synthetic/simulated data to plug coverage holes, and mixture controllers that re-balance when you see loss spikes or mode collapse. Stream from object stores with deterministic sharding and reproducible snapshots so runs are replayable and auditable.

Ship governance and telemetry with the data. Define a multimodal schema (text/code/image/audio/sensor/EHR) that carries lineage, consent/license tags, and retention windows. Publish a Data Card for each release (sources, proportions, filters, known risks), maintain a living risk register (privacy, bias, safety), and wire online signals—safety incidents, hallucination clusters, user-reported gaps—into the backlog for the next cut. Treat deletion as a first-class feature: fast traceability from sample → shards → checkpoints for “right to be forgotten.” Keep red-team corpora and adversarial prompts as training assets, not side files. Finally, set SLOs for the pipeline itself—freshness, audit latency, $$N_{\text{eff}}N_{\text{eff}}N_{eff}$$​/week, and cost per curated token—so Data Foundations runs with clear budgets and accountability.

## Data Infrastructure for Sim2Real and Real2Sim

**Sim2Real** is the process of taking models trained in simulation and making them robust enough to operate in the real world. It matters because training robots directly in reality is expensive, slow, and often unsafe. Simulation provides infinite data at low cost, but only if the gap between sim and real can be crossed. **Real2Sim** is the inverse process: feeding real-world logs back into the simulator so that the simulated environment stays faithful to the world it is supposed to represent. Without this calibration, simulators drift into fantasy, and the policies trained there collapse in deployment. Together, Sim2Real and Real2Sim form a loop: reality informs simulation, simulation trains policies, policies are deployed back into reality, and the cycle repeats. The strength of that loop is determined less by clever algorithms and more by the quality of the data infrastructure that connects the two sides. 

> **Sim2Real** refers to the transfer of models, policies, or representations trained in simulation to physical environments, with the objective of achieving robust performance despite discrepancies between simulated and real-world dynamics, sensing, and noise.

> **Real2Sim** denotes the process of leveraging real-world data to calibrate, update, or reconstruct smiulations such that the simulated environment accurately reflects physical reality, thereby improving the fidelity and utility of simulation for downstream training and evaluation. 

One of the biggest breakthroughs in closing the Sim2Real–Real2Sim loop has been the rise of massively parallel simulation engines like Isaac Gym, Mujoco, and Genesis. These systems run thousands of simulated environments in parallel on a single GPU cluster, making it possible to train embodied agents orders of magnitude faster than before. The innovation is not just raw throughput but the ability to integrate real-world parameter distributions directly into the simulation. Instead of hard-coded physics constants, friction coefficients or sensor noise models can be sampled from empirical data gathered in the field. The result is a simulator that reflects the statistical character of the real world, rather than a sanitized approximation.

On the real-world side, progress depends on how effectively you can log and prioritize data. Fleet-scale logging frameworks are beginning to treat data capture as an optimization problem: which episodes should we store in high fidelity, which can be compressed, and which deserve human review? Active learning signals - uncertainty in the policy's predictions, disagreement between ensemble models, sudden spikes in error - can drive the decision of what to log in detail. This shifts the burden away from brute-force data hoarding toward targeted capture of surprising or high-value events, ensuring that every gigabyte ingested moves the learning curve. Simulators also need high-fidelity reconstructions of the environments where robots operate. Here, neural rendering techniques such as NeRFs have emerged as a game changer. By reconstructing photo-realistic, metrically consistent 3D environments from raw camera logs, NeRFs allow digital twins to be built directly from field data. Robots can then rehearse their policies inside reconstructions of the very warehouses, homes, or clinics wher ethey will deploy. Unlike handcrafted assets, neural scene reconstructions update as new logs arrive, keeping the twin synchronized with reality. 

Calibration is another active area of innovation - traditional syste midentification relied on manual tuning of parameters **until sim and real trajectories aligned**. The new wave of _differentiable physics engines_ treats this as a gradient-based optimization problem: compute derivatives of simulated trajectories with respect to physical parameters, then fit those parameters directly against real-world logs. This makes calibration faster, more precise, and scalable across fleets of robots. Neural augmentations go further, learning residual corrections that capture unmodeled dynamics, giving the twin both analytic rigor and empirical fidelity. Benchmarking is still essential for the field to move forward - several benchmark datasets - RoboNet, BridgeData, ManiSkill - have been created to explicitly measure how well models transfer from sim to real. These datasets consist of standardized manipulation tasks, logged trajectories, and cross-platform benchmarks. By holding out certain robots or environments as "unseen", they provide a common yardstick for evaluating generalization. More importantly, they expose the role of data coverage: models trained on diverse, carefully curated logs tend to transfer far better, underscoring again that infrastructure is as decisive as algorithms.  

LimX Dynamics' **DreamActor** illustrates how these building blocks can be integrated into a cohesive pipeline. The system begins with **Real2Sim**, reconstructing 3D environments directly from consumer-grade camera data using multi-view geometry and physics-aware alignment. These reconstructed scenes are enriched with physical properties such as mass, friction, and collision meshes, creating digital twins that capture not just how the world looks but how it behaves. Within these twins, policies are pre-trained at scale using imitation learning and domain randomization, blending real trajectories with large volumes or simulated interaction to achieve broad generalization across tasks and environments. The loop then closes with **Sim2Real** and a final stage of _reinforcement learning in the real world_. Policies initialized in simulation are deployed onto hardware and refined with a small amount of real-world experience, stabilizing behavior and adapting to residual gaps between twin and reality. This Real2Sim-to-Sim2Real cycle exemplifies the direction of the field: multi-source data recipes that combine real logs, high-fidelity simulation, and scalable internet-level video datasets into one continuous workflow. DreamACtor shows that the frontier is less about inventing new algorithms, and more about designing data-driven pipelines that make embodied intelligence trainable, transferable, and reliable at scale.
