GPUs and custom AI hardware are the engines driving progress in AI research and applications. But raw hardware alone doesnâ€™t explain why some teams ship reliable systems at scale while others struggle with bottlenecks and cost explosions. The difference comes down to how you think about optimization.

A useful way to frame it is as **three nested loops** wrapped around every model. Each loop sits at a different layer of abstraction, and each has its own gauges, and levers. The innermost loop is about the raw efficiency of a single device: is the GPU actually doing useful math, or is it starved by memory bandwidth or kernel overhead? The next loop out is the training loop: how do we scale beyond one GPU and make hundreds or thousands of them behave like a single machine? And finally, there is the product loop: once the model is trained, can we serve it reliably under real-world traffic, meet our latency and safety SLOs, and do so at a cost per token that won't sink the business? 

What makes this framing powerful is that most "mysterious" performance or reliability problems stop being mysterious once you identify which loop you are really in. If a profiler shows long gaps on the GPU timeline, that is an inner loop problem. If throughput collapses when yous cale from one rack to three, that is the training loop. If P95 latency is spiky even though single-GPU kernels are fast, you are in the product loop. The moment you can name the loop, you know where to look and which tools to bring to bear. 

## The Inner Loop: making a single GPU sing

At the very center of AI infrastructure is the question: **is your GPU doing useful math, or is it wasting cycles?** Every model, no matter how large, eventually boils down to kernels running on a single device. If those kernels are inefficient, no amount of distributed wizardry will save you - because inefficiency just multiplies as you scale. The innermost loop is about runtime and kernel performance: understanding where the cycles are going, and how to keep the accelerator fed with a steady diet of compute. 

The mental model here is the _roofline_. Imagine a chart with two axes: arithmetic intensity (FLOPs per byte of memory moved) and achievable performance as a fraction of the device's peak. Your kernels live somewhere on this curve. If they are stuck in the low-intensity, memory-bound region, HBM-bandwidth - not Tensor Cores - is your bottleneck. If they are compute bound, the question becomes whether you are actually saturating those Tensor Cores. And if they are nowhere near the roofline at all, overheads are eating you alive - kernel launch latency, Python-GIL stalls [^1], or CPU-GPU syncs that keep the device idle. 

**Profiling is your compass:** Tools like Nsight Systems or PyTorch's built-in profilers don't just tell you how long each op takes - they show whether your GPU is mostly waiting on memory, struggling with occupancy, or simply not being kept busy. A typical training run might reveal long gaps between kernels, pointing to launch overhead. Or you might see HBM pegged at 90% while tensor utilization hovers at 20%, a classic sign that you are memory bound. 

This isn't just hypothetical. Microbenchmark studies on Volta and Turing GPUs have shown just how sharp the drop-offs can be. On Volta, for example, the L1 cache hit latency was measured at only 28 cycles, compared to 84 cycles on Pascal - nearly a 3 times improvement, but only if your working set fits. On Turing's T4, researchers found that vectorized 128-bit global memory instructions doubled the throughput of a simple SAXPY kernel compared to NVIDIA's own cuBLAS implementation that used 64-bit loads. The point is that the line between compute- and memory-bound is not theoretical: it shows up directly in latency histograms and throughput counters, and it shifts with every architectural generation. 

When _memory is the problem_, the fix is often algorithmic. Attention kernels are a perfect example. Naive implementations read and write enormouse intermediate matrices, swamping HBM. FlashAttention-style kernels, by contrast, restructure the computation to minimize memory traffic, moving closer to the compute-bound region of the roofline. Similarly, fusing QKV projections or using block-sparse attention can trade redundant memory ops for denser math. 

When _overhead is the problem_, you need to reduce the number of trips between host and device. Every kernel launch carries a cost, and if your training loop is littered with tiny ops, that cost adds up. The solution is fusion: combining bias, activation, and dropout in a single kernel, or capturing whole decode loops with CUDA Graphs so they run as a single replayable unit. The mantra is **"fewer, fatter kernels."**

And whent he GPU seems underfed, the problem often lies outside the device. Dataloaders stuck behind the Python GIL, disk I/O that cannot keep up with training, or underpinned host memory can all cause the device to starve. In those cases, the fix is not in CUDA at all but how you structure the pipeline feeding the accelerator: double-buffering, pagelocked transfers, and async prefetch all matter here. 

Finally, there are subtle low-level effects taht the microbenchmark papers document (Jia et al.) and that few developers think about. Volta and Turing both use two 64-bit wide register banks, which means that certain three-operand instructions like FFMA can still suffer from bank conflicts if all sources happen to map to the same bank. Researchers showed that remapping registers to avoid these conflicts yielded 15% throughput improvements. Similarly, the T4's "uniform datapath" for scalar integer ops was introduced precisely to prevent loop counters and address arithmetic from polluting the main floating-point pipelines. These are the kinds of details that explain why a kernel doesn't hit its theoretical throughput even when you've done everything else "right". 

> **In short**, _the inner loop is about **discipline at the kernel level**._ 

It is the layer where hardware meets math. Get this wrong, and your scaling experiments or serving infrastructure will always be operating at a handicap. Get it right, and you establish the foundation on which the outer loops - distributed training and serving - can actually pay off. 

### Memory hierarchy (L1/L2/TLB): why kernels stall

Modern accelerators live and die by their memory systems. The same kernel can look _compute-bound_ on one device and _memory-bound_ on another simply because L1/L2/DRAM behavior shifts the roofline under your feet. We will build a mental model of the GPU memory stack, and what to do when profiles show that our math engines are waiting. 

## The Training Loop: making many GPUs act like one

Once we have squeezed everything we can out of a single GPU, the next challenge is scale. Modern foundation models don't fit on a single device's memory, and even if they did, training them in a reasonable wall-clock time requires spreading the work across dozens, hundreds, or thousands of accelerators. That shift takes us from the **inner loop** (are we doing useful math on one GPU?) to the **training loop:** how do we coordinate many GPUs so they behave like one coherent machine? 

The essence of the training loop is deceptively simple. Every step of the gradient descent has two phases: forward/backward computation, and parameter updates. On a single device, this happens locally. At scale, the computation must be partitioned, and the updates must be communicated. Suddely, your "roofline" is no longer defined just by arithmetic intensity versus memory bandwidth - it is defined by the balance between compute, memory, and communication across the whole cluster. 

This introduces a new kind of bottleneck: the interconnect. Within a single node, GPUs may talk over NVLink or NVSwitch, with hundreds of GB/s bandwidth and low latency. Across racks, communication shfits to InfiniBand and Ethernet fabrics, where latency is higher and oversubscription looms. What looks compute-bound in isolation can become communication-bound at scale. For example, an attention layer that runs smoothly on eight GPUs might grind to a halt on 256 if gradient all-reduce saturates the fabric or if pipeline bubbles dominate. 

The training loop is also where parallelism strategies become design choices. Should you shard your data and simply average gradients (data parallelism)? Split your matmuls across devices (tensor parallelism)? Cut the model into layer chunks and run a conveyer belt (pipeline parallelism)? Or introduce sparsity with mixtures of experts (MoE)? Each strategy trades compute, memory, and communication differently, and the optimal recipe depends on both the model architecture and the topology of your hardware. 

And finally, the training loop is where **failure modes multiply**. On a single device, a kernel crash just means restarting the process. On a thousand-GPU job, one flaky node can stall everything unless you've built checkpointing, elasticity, and fault tolerance into the loop. The reliability of the whole training stack is set here. 

> **Put simply:** _the training loop is the art of making many GPUs act like one._ 

It's where distributed systems thinking meets numerical optimization. And it's the layer where your wall-clock training time is determined - not just by how fast a GPU runs its kernels, but by how efficiency you can keep a fleet of them working together without stepping on each other's toes. 

### The Mechanics of Parallelism

When you scale beyond a single GPU, you have four main levers to pull: **data parallelism, tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and mixture of experts**. Each one slices the problem differently. Think of them as four ways of making the same model fit into distributed hardware, each with its own costs and quirks. 

**Data parallelism** is the most straightforward. Every GPU (or groups of GPUs) gets a copy of the model, processes a different shard of the training data, and at the end of each step all the gradients are averaged. It is conceptually simple and works well for medium-sized models, but it comes with a hidden tax: every device must hold a fully copy of the model's parameters and optimizer state. For tody's multi-hundred-billion-parameter models, that memory overhead is unsustainable unless you shard optimizer state with systems like ZeRO or Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP). Data parallelism scales throughput linearly with more devices, but only if the all-reduce [^2] bandwidth is there to keep up. 

**Tensor parallelism:**

**Pipeline parallelism:**

In practice, large-scale training is almost always a hybrid. A cluster might use tensor parallelism inside a node to exploit NVLink bandwidth, pipeline parallelism across nodes to manage memory, and data parallelism on top to shard the dataset. MoE can be layered on top of that, introducing sparsity to extend capacity further. The art is in choosing the recipe that matches your topology. A 512-GPU DGX pod wired with NVSwitch will want a different mix than a cloud cluster built on Ethernet. 

This is the heart of the training loop: balancing compute, memory, and communication by deciding how to partition the model. Each form of parallelism is a different answer to the same question: _how do we make this model fit across the hardware we actually have, without leaving performance on the floor?_

This effectively serializes execution and can cause application-wide delays, leading to unresponsiveness.

The first phase **reduction phase** each device calculates its local contribution to the overall computation (e.g. gradients from a subset of data), and these are then combined "reduced" across all devices (via summation, averaging or another operation) to incorporate into a global result. The second phase is the **broadcast phase** where the aggregated global result is then distributed back to all participating devices, so every device has access to the same, synchronized information for subsequent steps.
