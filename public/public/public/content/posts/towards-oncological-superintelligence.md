Cancer has always been a disease of time. Time until the lump is discovered, time until diagnosis, time until a therapy is chosen, time bought by treatments that stretch survival by months when decades are needed. For patients and families, each interval is both hope and dread. For clinicians, it is the weight of complexity and uncertainty pressed into every decision.

I believe we can change the slope of that story. Artificial intelligence is often described as a tool, but in oncology it could become something deeper: a kind of superintelligence woven through the discipline, catalyzing progress at the pace of ideas rather than the pace of paperwork and bottlenecked trials.

What would this look like? Imagine an oncologist no longer drowning in fragmented notes, pathology slides, genomic reports, and insurance forms. Instead, the full record of a patient’s biology and history is harmonized into one living canvas—auditable, interpretable, and constantly refreshed. Behind it hums a system that can run a million “virtual experiments” before the next clinic visit, narrowing the possibilities to those most likely to help. Treatments are not proposed as black boxes, but as transparent hypotheses: *here is why this combination targets the tumor’s pathways; here is what we have learned from patients like yours; here are the risks we must weigh together.*

In such a world, oncologists are not displaced but amplified. Freed from administrative drag, they can spend their time where machines cannot: listening, guiding, and offering the human presence that no model can simulate. Patients are not passive recipients but active participants, with the evidence behind their care visible and comprehensible.

Oncological superintelligence is not a single model or breakthrough. It is the weaving together of data, algorithms, and governance into a discipline that feels less like a desperate chase after cancer, and more like a confident stride toward its prevention and cure. If we build it carefully—grounded in provenance, equity, and trust—it could shift the lived experience of cancer from fear and uncertainty to clarity, prevention, and long life.

This is the story I want to help write: one where oncology becomes, at last, a field defined not by scarcity of time, but by an abundance of intelligence placed in service of human flourishing.
