Alongside them, I was fortunate to personally invest in <a href=https://synchron.com/><strong>Synchron</strong>&rsquo;s Series D</a>, which is pioneering endovascular brain-computer interface technology for patients worldwide. As a member of <strong>Asia Society&rsquo;s Dragon and Eagle Rising Leaders Council</strong>, I am part of a wonderful community that helps to promote crucial dialogue between the East and the West in areas such as AI Governance and Oncology Clinical Trial Harmonization.</p><p>I have previously worked at <strong>Apple</strong> and <strong>NVIDIA</strong>, and completed my undergraduate and graduate studies in Mathematics and Computer Science at <strong>Stanford University</strong>, working with phenomenal researchers at <a href=https://ai.stanford.edu/>SAIL</a>, <a href=https://hai.stanford.edu/>HAI</a>, <a href=https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.124.325652>Stanford Cardiovascular Institute</a>, and <a href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11058715>Stanford Neurosurgery</a>. Earlier in my life, I was deeply involved Olympiad Mathematics, earning Gold/Silver medals at the British and Asian Pacific Mathematical Olympiads, and representing Hong Kong at the International Mathematical Olympiad as HKG01.</p><p>Together with cofounders, I started <em><strong>Eiro</strong></em> a stealth platform building a global pervasive fabric defining multimodal AI infrastructure for science and medicine. Outside of work, I stay grounded through endurance running, music, and time with my family.</p><hr><p>I believe AI should be judged by a simple standard: does it catalyze human flourishing? If we align it to that purpose, the next decade can transform healthcare, science, and society in ways that expand dignity, health, and possibility. Oncology, cardiology, neuroscience—fields that move at the pace of experiments and regulation—can begin to move at the pace of ideas, with a thousand careful collaborators working in parallel rather than a handful working in series.</p><p>In healthcare, intelligence is not magic; it is the ability to ask better questions, design cleaner experiments, and translate evidence into care that reaches everyone. AI will help us do the mundane work that matters: harmonizing messy data, auditing provenance, spotting bias before it harms, and running countless “virtual experiments” to narrow real ones. That is how you make discovery predictable rather than lucky. It is also how you make care safer: every recommendation traceable, every assumption testable, every model re-trained against drift and equity metrics, not only accuracy.</p><p>Oncology shows the shape of what’s possible. Earlier detection with multimodal signals; prevention that targets risk long before disease; therapies individualized by mechanism rather than by average trial effects; trials accelerated because effect sizes are larger and endpoints are measured in days and weeks, not years. The right outcome isn’t just “more tools”—it’s fewer late diagnoses, fewer treatments that barely work, and far more lives lived in health.</p><p>The same arc applies to the mind. Better measurements and gentler interventions can make depression, PTSD, addiction, and many cognitive disorders far rarer—and give everyone more clarity, focus, and emotional steadiness. This is not about replacing human judgment; it is about restoring it. When the ambient noise of illness and administrative overload quiets, clinicians can practice the parts of medicine that only humans can do: presence, explanation, and trust.</p><p>Equity is a design constraint, not a press release. A world where only a few can access these benefits would be a moral failure. The infrastructure must assume distribution from day one: models that run cheaply, protocols that survive messy reality, supply chains that work in low-resource settings, and incentives that reward outcomes, not billable complexity. If we get that right, the rising curve of health will not be confined to a handful of postal codes.</p><p>This is also a governance problem. We should build systems that are auditable by default; that treat privacy as a first-class requirement; that give regulators live windows into model behavior; and that let patients see the evidence behind their care. Stronger rights and better institutions are not a tax on innovation—they are what make breakthroughs durable and worthy of trust.</p><p>What, then, is the role of people? More human than before. AI can draft, search, summarize, and simulate; people decide what matters, set the constraints, and carry responsibility. The goal is not to automate medicine; it is to <strong>amplify</strong> clinicians and researchers so that excellence becomes average and average becomes unacceptable.</p><p>If we succeed, the visible signs will be simple: fewer funerals cut short by cancer; fewer lives narrowed by chronic disease or untreated mental illness; more healthy years, everywhere. The deeper sign will be quieter: a healthcare system that feels competent, kind, and transparent because it is engineered to be all three.</p><p>This is the future I’m working toward: trustworthy intelligence, built for care; rigorous science, accelerated; and a health system that finally earns the confidence people want to give it—an era where AI catalyzes human flourishing.</p><p><em>Thank you to <a href=https://www.darioamodei.com/>Dario Amodei</a> for providing the template for this website</em></p></section><section><h2>Posts</h2><ul><li><a href=https://brucechanglongxu.github.io/posts/crouchercardiovascular/>Croucher Foundation Cardiovascular Invited Lecture</a></li><li><a href=https://brucechanglongxu.github.io/posts/synchron/>Investing in Synchron: Building Cognitive General Intelligence</a></li><li><a href=https://brucechanglongxu.github.io/posts/mc3-labs/>Reflections on Building MC3-Labs with Mayo Clinic</a></li><li><a href=https://brucechanglongxu.github.io/posts/hkgagc/>Reflections on Organising a Global AI Governance Summit</a></li><li><a href=https://brucechanglongxu.github.io/posts/towards-oncological-superintelligence/>Towards Oncological Superintelligence</a></li></ul></section></article></main><footer><div class=footer-content><p>&copy; 2025 Bruce C.
