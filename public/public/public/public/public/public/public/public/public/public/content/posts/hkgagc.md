Artificial intelligence is advancing faster than the frameworks that might guide its use. Conversations about risk and opportunity are dominated by Washington, Brussels, and Beijing. But if AI is to truly benefit humanity, the conversation cannot remain fragmented â€” it must be global, inclusive, and grounded in trust. This year, I began organizing the inaugural Hong Kong Global AI Governance Summit alongside one of my closest friends and colleagues. The vision is simple but ambitious: to bring together researchers, policymakers, clinicians, entrepreneurs, and civic leaders from across the U.S., China, and beyond to discuss how we can shape frontier AI toward human flourishing.
