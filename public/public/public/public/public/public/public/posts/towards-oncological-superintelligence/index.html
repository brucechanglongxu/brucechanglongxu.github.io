Time until the BCR-ABL translocation is recognized in a patient’s marrow; time until sequencing reveals a KRAS mutation in a pancreatic biopsy; time until MYC amplification is confirmed in a lymphoma panel. Time until a therapy is chosen, and then time bought by treatments that stretch survival by months when decades are needed. For patients and families, each interval is both hope and dread. For clinicians, it is the weight of complexity and uncertainty pressed into every decision.</p><p>I believe we can change the slope of that story. Artificial intelligence is often described as a tool, but in oncology it could become something deeper: a kind of superintelligence woven through the discipline—catalyzing progress at the pace of molecular hypotheses, not just the pace of paperwork and bottlenecked trials.</p><p>What would this look like? Imagine an oncologist no longer drowning in fragmented EMR notes, immunohistochemistry slides, and exome sequencing reports. Instead, the full record of a patient’s mutational landscape, clonal evolution, proteomic signatures, and immune microenvironment is harmonized into a single living canvas—auditable, interpretable, and constantly refreshed. Behind it hums a system that can simulate a million “virtual experiments” before the next clinic visit: testing how an allosteric ABL inhibitor would perform in the presence of T315I resistance mutations, or whether combining a KRAS G12C inhibitor with an immune checkpoint blockade might extend remission in a specific genomic context.</p><p>Therapies are not proposed as opaque outputs, but as transparent mechanistic hypotheses: this combination targets MAPK reactivation via ERK feedback; this molecule is predicted to stabilize MYC degradation through a novel allosteric pocket; here is the probability of resistance emerging through bypass PI3K signaling within 6 months. The oncologist’s role shifts from information triage to judgment, consent, and empathy, supported by a system that lays bare the mechanistic logic behind every option.</p><p>In such a world, oncologists are not displaced but amplified. Freed from administrative drag and partial information, they can spend their time where machines cannot: listening, guiding, and offering the human presence that no algorithm can simulate. Patients are not passive recipients but active participants, with the mechanistic rationale behind their care visible, comprehensible, and open to dialogue.</p><p>Oncological superintelligence is not a single model or biomarker. It is the weaving together of clinical trial data, mutational atlases, synthetic lethality maps, and drug–target interaction networks into a discipline that feels less like a desperate chase after cancer and more like a confident stride toward its prevention and cure. If built carefully—grounded in provenance, equity, and trust—it could transform oncology into a field defined not by waiting for the next marginal survival curve, but by continuous, mechanistic innovation at scale.</p><p>This is the story I want to help write: one where the frontier of oncology is no longer bounded by the latency of experiments or the silos of data, but is instead propelled by an abundance of intelligence—human and artificial—placed in service of human flourishing.</p></article></main><footer><div class=footer-content><p>&copy; 2025 Bruce C.
