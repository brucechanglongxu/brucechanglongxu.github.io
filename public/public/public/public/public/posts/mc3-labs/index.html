The mission is simple but ambitious: to weave data, models, and clinical expertise into systems that can truly translate from platform to bedside.</p><p>In shaping MC3-Labs, I’ve been fortunate to work across several projects that illustrate this vision:</p><ol><li><strong>Platform to Bedside (npj Digital Medicine Review):</strong> Together with Mayo colleagues, I co-authored a review submitted to npj Digital Medicine that mapped the translational pipeline for AI in healthcare — from data curation and foundation models to regulatory and clinical integration. This framework helped us think beyond model performance, focusing instead on how to build reproducible, interoperable, and bedside-ready AI platforms.</li><li><strong>Spatial Reasoning AI (SRAI) in Medicine:</strong> We undertook one of the first scoping reviews of Spatial Reasoning AI, exploring how AI systems can reason over anatomy, motion, and workflow — not just static images. For fields like cardiology and surgery, this is essential: an echocardiogram is dynamic, a surgical field is evolving, and ICU signals unfold beat by beat. Embedding reasoning into these contexts is key to moving from lab prototypes to clinical tools.</li><li><strong>Foundation Models for Cardiology & Myocarditis:</strong> At MC3-Labs, we began laying the groundwork for a multimodal cardiovascular foundation model, integrating echocardiography, ECG, cardiac MRI, and clinical notes. As a pilot disease, we focused on myocarditis, which is heterogeneous and often misdiagnosed. By curating viral, ICI-related, ischemic, and fulminant subtypes, we aimed to explore whether foundation models could capture subtle signatures that traditional diagnostics miss.</li><li><strong>Partnerships and MOSAIC (Yosemite / Reed Jobs Oncology Fund):</strong> We&rsquo;ve engaged with Yosemite (Reed Jobs’ oncology fund), contributing to early discussions around MOSAIC, a multimodal immuno-oncology response predictor. These conversations underscored how academic infrastructure like MC3-Labs can connect with external partners — bringing rigorous, provenance-aware data pipelines into dialogue with funders and translational networks eager to accelerate clinical impact, to attract up to 400k USD funding to our lab.</li></ol><p>Looking back, what excites me most is not any single paper or pilot, but the ecosystem we’re starting to build. MC3-Labs is becoming a platform: data pipelines, foundation model workflows, and translational collaborations that can scale across oncology, cardiology, and beyond. The journey from platform to bedside is never quick — but by uniting clinical excellence at Mayo with external partnerships like Yosemite, I believe we are beginning to sketch a roadmap for how trustworthy, scalable AI in medicine can truly take shape.</p></article></main><footer><div class=footer-content><p>&copy; 2025 Bruce C.
